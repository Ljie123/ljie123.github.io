I am an Associate Professor at School of Software, Beihang University. 
Before joining in Beihang, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Software System Security Assurance Group](http://wingtecher.com/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). 
I got my Ph.D. degree in software engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Jiaguang Sun](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1166/93889.htm) and [Prof. Yu Jiang](
https://sites.google.com/site/jiangyu198964) from Tsinghua University in 2022.6.
I received BS degree in computer science from the Beijing University of Post and Telecommunication, China, in 2017.6. 

<p>My research interests include vulnerability detection, fuzzing, and software engineering.</p>
